# Bass_Quiz

I created this to train myself about keys and their placement on different instrument, try it out, it might help you with your journey.

Next I would like the quiz to start with 30 metronome ticks instead of seconds, every question you get right gives you bonus ticks but also increases the speed of the metronome when you a question wrong you lose ticks. after 30 seconds the user gets to a new level where the bpm is 10 bpm faster than the previous level. The starting bpm is set to 40 bpm the user gets to 120 they win.
